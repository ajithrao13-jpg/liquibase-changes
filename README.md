## 🎯 Key Takeaways for Tomorrow's Discussion

### Point 1: K6 on AWS
- **Most Common**: Teams run k6 from EC2 instances in the same region
- **Metrics Export**: CloudWatch (easiest), InfluxDB+Grafana (rich), K6 Cloud (managed)
- **Integration**: CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, Jenkins

### Point 2: Critical Metrics
1. **IteratorAgeMilliseconds** - Are we falling behind?
2. **Lambda Duration** - Processing efficiency
3. **Lambda Errors** - Reliability
4. **Throttles** - Capacity issues  
5. **RecordProcessingLatency** - End-to-end performance

### Point 3: Testing Plan
- **Payload Sizes**: 100B, 500B (baseline), 1KB, 5KB, 10KB
- **Load Levels**: 10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000+ RPS
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks (Baseline → Sustained → Stress → Large Payloads → Endurance)
- **Deliverables**: Performance baseline, bottlenecks, optimizations, cost analysis
