# Meeting Preparation: K6 Performance Testing Discussion

## 📋 Executive Summary for Manager

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Topic**: K6 Performance Testing for Kinesis + Lambda Pipeline  
**Status**: ✅ Fully Prepared with Complete Documentation and Testing Plan

---

## 🎯 Three Key Discussion Points - ANSWERED

### 1. How Teams Use K6 Against AWS Applications ✅

**Question**: "Check with teams who use k6 against their application on AWS and how they collect performance metrics"

**Answer Summary**:
- **Deployment**: Teams primarily run k6 from EC2 instances in the same AWS region as their applications
- **Alternatives**: ECS/EKS containers, K6 Cloud (managed service), or local machines for development
- **Metrics Collection**: 
  - CloudWatch (most popular, AWS-native)
  - InfluxDB + Grafana (best visualization)
  - K6 Cloud (easiest, no setup)
  - Prometheus, DataDog (enterprise)

**Key Insight**: Most teams prefer CloudWatch for production monitoring because it integrates seamlessly with other AWS services and provides cost-effective long-term storage.

**Full Details**: See [k6-performance-testing-guide.md](./k6-performance-testing-guide.md)

### 2. Metrics to Collect for Kinesis + Lambda Pipeline ✅

**Question**: "What metrics we need to collect for our kinesis+lambda pipeline and what would be relevant"

**Answer Summary**:
We need to monitor **6 critical metrics** (priority order):

| Priority | Metric | What It Shows | Target |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| 🥇 #1 | **IteratorAgeMilliseconds** | Are we falling behind? | < 1000ms |
| 🥈 #2 | **Lambda Duration** | Processing speed | < 50% of timeout |
| 🥉 #3 | **Lambda Errors** | Reliability | < 0.1% error rate |
| 4 | **Throttles** (Kinesis + Lambda) | Capacity issues | 0 |
| 5 | **Throughput Match** | Data flow health | IncomingRecords ≈ Invocations |
| 6 | **RecordProcessingLatency** | End-to-end performance | < 2000ms |

**Additional Metrics**: We've documented 30+ metrics across 5 categories:
- Kinesis Stream Metrics (10)
- Lambda Execution Metrics (8)
- End-to-End Pipeline Metrics (7)
- Cost Metrics (4)
- K6 Load Testing Metrics (4)

**Key Insight**: Start with the top 6 metrics. Once baseline is established, expand to comprehensive monitoring.

**Full Details**: See [kinesis-lambda-metrics.md](./kinesis-lambda-metrics.md)

### 3. Testing Plan with Different Payload Sizes ✅

**Question**: "Come up with a plan - different payloads like 100, 200, 300, etc. and metrics to collect"

**Answer Summary**:

#### Payload Sizes
- **100 bytes** - Small events (IoT sensors)
- **500 bytes** - Standard events (PRIMARY BASELINE) ⭐
- **1 KB** - Detailed records
- **5 KB** - Complex data
- **10 KB** - Near maximum size

#### Load Variations (per payload size)
10 RPS → 50 → 100 → 200 → 500 → 1000 → 2000+ records/second

#### Testing Timeline: 4 Weeks

**Week 1: Baseline Performance**
- Test all payload sizes (100B, 500B, 1KB) at varying loads
- Deliverable: Performance baseline report

**Week 2: Sustained Load**
- 30-minute sustained load test
- Variable traffic patterns
- Deliverable: Stability confirmation

**Week 3: Stress & Spike**
- Find breaking points (gradual stress)
- Sudden traffic spike (50→500 RPS)
- Deliverable: Breaking point analysis

**Week 4: Endurance & Large Payloads**
- 24-hour endurance test
- 5KB and 10KB payload tests
- Deliverable: Long-term stability report

**Key Insight**: We can start testing TODAY with ready-to-use K6 scripts and CloudWatch dashboards.

**Full Details**: See [performance-testing-plan.md](./performance-testing-plan.md)

## 💡 Key Talking Points for Meeting

### Point 1: We Know How Teams Do It
"I've researched how other teams use K6 on AWS. The most common approach is running K6 from EC2 instances in the same region as the application, with metrics exported to CloudWatch for monitoring. Some teams also use InfluxDB + Grafana for richer visualization, and K6 Cloud for a managed solution."

### Point 2: We Know What to Measure
"I've identified 6 critical metrics we must monitor, with IteratorAgeMilliseconds being #1 - it tells us if we're falling behind in processing. I've also documented 30+ additional metrics organized by component: Kinesis, Lambda, end-to-end pipeline, and costs."

### Point 3: We Have a Complete Plan
"I've created a 4-week testing plan testing 5 different payload sizes from 100 bytes to 10KB, with load varying from 10 to 2000+ records per second. Each week has specific deliverables, and I have ready-to-use K6 scripts we can run immediately."

## ❓ Questions to Ask Manager

### Critical Information Needed
1. **What is our expected production load?** (records/second)
2. **What is our current Kinesis configuration?** (number of shards)
3. **What are our Lambda settings?** (memory, timeout)
4. **Do we have a test environment ready?** (or do we need to create one)
5. **What's our testing budget?** (~$15 for full test cycle)
6. **Timeline expectations?** (can start this week)
7. **Who else should be involved?** (DevOps, SRE, other teams)

### Clarification Questions
